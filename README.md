<h1> This is my project</h1>

I wanted to create an online CV and portfolio for people to look at when wanting to hire someone new. 

This is a personal website and I have used some of my own qualifications as well as some portfolio examples that are websites I have created using wix. 

I wanted to create an astecically pleasing webiste that showcased the skills that I have already learnt during my time on the course. 
I wanted to display a photo of myself to give the user a feel for my personality and looks, as well as displaying a personal touch to the design. 
I enjoyed working on this project but there was an issue with a crash that caused me to lose my commits and back ups. 
I had backed up everything i needed in a word documents luckily but it meant that I didn't show my commits.
