<h1> This is my project</h1>

I wanted to create an online CV and portfolio for people to look at when wanting to hire someone new. 

This is a personal website and I have used some of my own qualifications as well as some portfolio examples that are websites I have created using wix. 

I wanted to create an astecically pleasing webiste that showcased the skills that I have already learnt during my time on the course. 
I wanted to display a photo of myself to give the user a feel for my personality and looks, as well as displaying a personal touch to the design. 
I enjoyed working on this project but there was an issue with a crash that caused me to lose my commits and back ups. 
I had backed up everything i needed in a word documents luckily but it meant that I didn't show my commits. 

In this project I wanted to display my professionalism and design. I didn't want the website to be overwhelming with colour and photos, so I kept the design to a minimum but professional design. 

I wanted to view this document as something that I can develop and use in the future, once completing the course, to demonstrate the skills I have learnt in this course.

I used some bootstrap in the desgin to give it a more responsive design and layout. I then adopted these css inputs with my own colour and positioning using my css files. 

Overall I am very happy with the result of this website and cannot wait to develop this further.
