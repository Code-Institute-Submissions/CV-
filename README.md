<h1> This is my project</h1>

I wanted to create an online CV and portfolio for people to look at when wanting to hire someone new. 

This is a personal website and I have used some of my own qualifications as well as some portfolio examples that are websites I have created using wix. 

I wanted to create an astecically pleasing webiste that showcased the skills that I have already learnt during my time on the course. 
I wanted to display a photo of myself to give the user a feel for my personality and looks, as well as displaying a personal touch to the design. 
I enjoyed working on this project but there was an issue with a crash that caused me to lose my commits and back ups. 
I had backed up everything i needed in a word documents luckily but it meant that I didn't show my commits. 

In this project I wanted to display my professionalism and design. I didn't want the website to be overwhelming with colour and photos, so I kept the design to a minimum but professional design. 

I wanted to view this document as something that I can develop and use in the future, once completing the course, to demonstrate the skills I have learnt in this course.

I used some bootstrap in the desgin to give it a more responsive design and layout. I then adopted these css inputs with my own colour and positioning using my css files. 

The design of the webiste is very clear. Everything is labeled correctly easy to see, and I believe that things pop off the page in a way that will draw your eye to certain parts of the documentation.

I did many tests on this webiste, especially trying to break it and I contanstly used the python3 -m https.server port to view the code and how it was working. 

Overall I am very happy with the result of this website and cannot wait to develop this further.
